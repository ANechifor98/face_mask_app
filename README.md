The Facial Recognition App is an application that involves the user opening their camera and being assisted in the act of taking a picture or uploading a picture in order to have a facial recognition model applied to the image. Once the model has analyzed the picture, the results are returned and displayed to the user. The application will inform the user of whether or not they are wearing a mask and if they are wearing the mask correctly or incorrectly. The facial recognition system is developed, trained and tested using a large, public and publicly available online dataset of thousands of images that contains many images of faces with both masks on and masks off. The user will also have the ability to upload their own dataset and have it analysed as well. The goal of this project is to provide users with the ability to detect if someone is wearing a face mask and if that person is wearing the mask correctly or incorrectly.
